# Data Analysis Udacity Nanodegree
This repo contains my projects for Udacity Nanodegree Data Analysis. You can find my certificate [here](confirm.udacity.com/UEQTHDPG).

## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset
In this project, I have gone through the data analysis process and saw how everything fits together. I have learned how to use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

This project is based on the dataset which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

## Project 2: Wrangle and Analyze Data
In this project, I have practiced skills of data wrangling using real-world data. Data wrangling process consists three parts: gather, assess and clean. The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 

First, I have gathered data in different format from different sources. Then I have assessed the data both visually and programmatically to identify any data quality issues and tidiness issues. After that, I have cleaned data to fix all the issues. Finally, I have analyzed the cleaned dataset and visualize the results.

## Project 3: Communicate Data Findings
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I have used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I have produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in your selected dataset.
This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
