This repo contains my projects for Udacity Nanodegree Data Analysis. You can find my certificate [here](confirm.udacity.com/UEQTHDPG).

## Project 1: Investigate a Dataset
In this project, I have gone through the data analysis process and saw how everything fits together. I have learned how to use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

This project is based on the dataset which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
